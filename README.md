# Introduction

RedisEconomy is an affordable cross-server plugin for real-time management and synchronization of your in-game money across multiple servers

The plugin is also proxy-less, meaning it **doesn't require any additional proxy plugins!!**\

Unlike some data bridges, the data storage is Redis instead of a slow MySQL\
More information [here (Benchmarks)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f4gG-muUXa_wYlLxlLMRUk4cRT8UQCfLxoGgza-Mv-k)

RedisEconomy takes advantage of a particular data structure of Redis called [SortedSet](https://redis.io/glossary/redis-sorted-sets/)\
Since MySQL doesn't have this kind of data structure, a SQL database would be many times slower than a Redis NoSQL database
